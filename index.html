                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #7f8c8d;">
                    I bring a hands-on, collaborative leadership style rooted in technical credibility and continuous
                    improvement. My goal is to build a high-performing engineering team that blends modern best
                    practices with Avidity’s strong commercial acumen. I thrive at the intersection of systems, people,
                    and purpose — and believe that digital transformation should be a strategic enabler of business
                    success.

                <p style="color: #7f8c8d;">
                    This 90-day plan is a living framework, designed to adapt based on team insights, stakeholder
                    feedback, and emerging priorities. I will listen first, act quickly, and iterate with transparency
                    and intent.

                        (McCurrach, Standout, Wave, Thumbprint, and Zing), Avidity operates at significant scale in the
                        fast-moving FMCG sector. My approach will ensure digital practices can support this
                        continued growth while maintaining operational excellence across all agencies.</p>

                        flows between them, and how authentication is managed. This will help us:
