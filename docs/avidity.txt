“FMCG” stands for Fast-Moving Consumer Goods, which refers to products that are sold quickly at relatively low cost — like packaged foods, beverages, toiletries, cleaning products, over-the-counter drugs, and other household items.

FMCG leadership roles are senior or executive positions within companies that manufacture, distribute, or sell these kinds of products. These roles typically involve overseeing business units, driving growth, managing brands, and ensuring products get to market efficiently.

Some examples of FMCG leadership roles include:

✅ Chief Executive Officer (CEO) → Oversees the entire organization’s strategy and performance
✅ Marketing Director / Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) → Leads brand strategy, consumer marketing, and market positioning
✅ Sales Director / Commercial Director → Responsible for driving sales, distribution, and customer relationships
✅ Supply Chain Director → Manages production, logistics, and delivery to keep shelves stocked
✅ Category Manager → Focuses on product categories (like snacks, beverages) and their performance
✅ Brand Manager → Oversees individual brands or product lines, ensuring they meet consumer needs and market goals
✅ Innovation or R&D Director → Leads development of new products and improvements to existing ones
✅ Finance Director / CFO → Oversees financial strategy, budgets, and profitability

In summary, FMCG leadership roles are about driving performance, innovation, and growth in industries where products need to move quickly through the market to consumers.

Avidity itself does not produce or sell physical consumer products or software that you would hold in your hand.

Instead, Avidity is a sales and marketing services company — they sell expertise, people, and solutions that help other companies (usually consumer brands) improve how their products are sold, marketed, and positioned in stores and online.

Here’s a clearer breakdown:

✅ What they “sell” → services and expertise, such as:

Field sales teams who visit retail stores to make sure products are on shelves and well displayed

Brand activation teams who run in-store demos, sampling, or events

Data analytics to help brands understand which stores or channels need more focus

Tactical sales initiatives to boost short-term sales (like promotions or campaigns)

Consumer experience design to improve how brands engage customers

✅ Who they work for → major brands, like Unilever, Colgate, Microsoft, Nespresso, etc.
Those companies make the products — Avidity helps get those products into shoppers’ hands more effectively.

✅ What they don’t sell →

No consumer product with the Avidity name on it

No standalone software platform for public sale

No physical good or app you’d buy as an individual customer

In short, Avidity sells support services to brands and companies, not products to consumers.

EPOS stands for Electronic Point of Sale.

In simple terms, an EPOS system is the combination of hardware and software that businesses (like shops, restaurants, or service providers) use to:

✅ process sales and payments (card, cash, etc.)
✅ track inventory and stock levels
✅ record customer purchases
✅ generate reports on sales performance

A typical EPOS setup includes things like:

a touchscreen terminal or computer

barcode scanner

receipt printer

card payment machine (card reader)

EPOS software that connects all of this together

For example, when you buy something at a grocery store or pharmacy and the cashier scans your items — they are using an EPOS system.

In Avidity’s context, EPOS data and analytics means they use sales data collected from these systems to:

analyze which products are selling well

identify underperforming stores or regions

plan better promotions or product placement

help their clients make data-driven decisions to boost sales

So, EPOS isn’t a product you hold — it’s the digital backbone that runs sales at checkout points.

how companies like Avidity use EPOS data to help brands:

🔍 Step 1: Collect the data
Avidity’s team gathers EPOS data from retail partners — this includes:

what products were sold

when they were sold (date, time)

where they were sold (store location, region)

how many units were sold

at what price (including discounts or promotions)

Example: Nespresso pods sold at 100 supermarkets over the past month.

📊 Step 2: Analyze performance
Avidity’s analysts or software systems then look for patterns and insights, such as:

Which stores are top-performing and which are lagging

Which products are selling fastest or slowest

Whether promotions actually boosted sales

Whether some products are frequently out of stock (missed sales opportunities)

Example: They discover that caramel Nespresso pods are consistently out of stock in Glasgow but not in Edinburgh.

🚀 Step 3: Recommend actions
Based on the analysis, Avidity can make concrete recommendations to improve sales, such as:

Increase stock levels or deliveries to high-demand stores

Run in-store promotions or sampling events in underperforming regions

Change how products are displayed on shelves (better visibility)

Adjust pricing or promotional discounts

Example: Avidity tells Nespresso to run a 2-for-£5 promo in underperforming stores and restock caramel pods in Glasgow.

👥 Step 4: Activate teams
Avidity’s field teams or activation teams then go out and help make these improvements happen on the ground:

Merchandisers tidy or reposition shelves

Field sales reps check stock and talk to store managers

Brand ambassadors run tasting events

📈 Step 5: Measure results
Finally, Avidity tracks new EPOS data after the interventions to see if sales improved, and then they fine-tune the strategy.

✅ In short:
EPOS data → insights → targeted actions → increased sales → measure & refine.
Here’s why companies like Avidity exist even though stores have EPOS data themselves:

💥 1. Retailers and brands have different priorities
Retailers (like Tesco, Boots, or Asda) focus on overall store sales, profit margins, and operations across thousands of products.

Brands (like Nespresso, Unilever, or Colgate) care specifically about their own product performance within those stores.

Retailers don’t have the time or incentive to optimize every brand’s sales — that’s where Avidity steps in, working on behalf of the brand to improve their performance inside the retailer’s world.

💥 2. Not all retailers share detailed data
Some retailers limit how much product-level data they share with brands.

Avidity has built relationships, agreements, and technology that help extract and interpret whatever data is available.

💥 3. Brands don’t have “feet on the ground”
Even if a brand has the data, it can’t easily send its own people into 500 stores to check displays, train staff, or set up promotions.

Avidity has field teams and local presence ready to act across many stores and regions.

💥 4. Advanced analytics and expertise
Raw EPOS data is messy and vast.

Avidity offers specialized tools, data science, and expertise to extract meaningful insights and translate them into actions, not just reports.

💥 5. Execution power
Insight without execution doesn’t change sales.

Avidity combines data + people to make change happen in stores, which most brands and many retailers can’t do effectively on their own.

📍 Summary
It’s not that stores can’t do it — it’s that:

they have other priorities

brands want their own sales focus

Avidity offers specialist expertise + action teams
