For an organization like Avidity, which operates in the fast-paced world of retail sales, marketing, and field activation, here‚Äôs what they are most likely using or combining today:

üíº Likely demand forecasting systems or tools at Avidity
‚úÖ NielsenIQ or IRI (Circana) solutions

Because Avidity works with top FMCG brands (like Unilever, Nespresso, Rimmel), they probably license retail panel data and forecasting tools from NielsenIQ or IRI.

These platforms help with:

multi-channel demand forecasts

promotional impact modeling

competitor benchmarks

‚úÖ RELEX Solutions or Blue Yonder (JDA Software)

For retail execution, merchandising, and demand prediction across thousands of SKUs and stores.

These systems handle replenishment planning and can automate recommendations for the field teams Avidity deploys.

‚úÖ Power BI + custom demand models

Avidity has an internal data and analytics team that almost certainly builds Power BI dashboards, possibly backed by machine learning models built with:

Azure ML / AutoML (since they‚Äôre often Microsoft stack users)

Python models (e.g., Prophet or Scikit-learn) integrated into reporting workflows.

‚úÖ Client-owned ERP forecasts (SAP / Oracle)

Importantly, Avidity‚Äôs own systems probably consume demand forecasts provided by their brand clients‚Äô ERP systems (like SAP IBP or Oracle Demand Management Cloud) and then use them to inform:

where to send field teams

how to prioritize store visits

which promotions or SKUs need attention

‚úÖ Field team optimization platforms (Repsly, StayinFront, GoSpotCheck)

These don‚Äôt generate demand forecasts, but they consume forecast insights and push them into the hands of reps and merchandisers.

üõ† Hybrid model likely in use:
Top-down forecasts ‚Üí provided by major retailers, brands, or syndicated data providers

Mid-layer refinement ‚Üí Avidity‚Äôs analytics team customizes this by region, product, and client need

Bottom-up execution ‚Üí field team software puts recommendations into action at the shelf level

‚ö° Why they probably don‚Äôt use only open-source tools (like Prophet)
Open-source tools like Prophet or Darts are great, but they require a data science team + clean data pipelines to work at enterprise scale.

Avidity may experiment with these in-house, but for most clients, they lean on proven commercial solutions that integrate with retail systems.
