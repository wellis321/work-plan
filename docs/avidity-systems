🌐 Likely systems landscape at Avidity
✅ Core platforms

CRM systems for client relationships (Salesforce or Dynamics)

Field service management tools (Repsly, StayinFront, GoSpotCheck)

Project management tools (Asana, Jira, or Trello)

Finance & HR systems (Sage, Workday, or similar)

Marketing ops platforms (for campaign tracking)

✅ Data ecosystem

EPOS data from retailers

Syndicated data (NielsenIQ, IRI)

Internal sales + performance data

Power BI dashboards for clients + internal teams

✅ Infrastructure

Likely hybrid cloud/on-prem setup

Mix of legacy systems (especially in finance or HR) + modern cloud SaaS tools

Fragmented data silos across agencies (McCurrach, Standout, Wave, Thumbprint, Zing)

✅ People + processes

Heavy reliance on human expertise in field ops

Analytics teams using a mix of Excel, Power BI, and some SQL or Python

IT teams managing operational stability, security, and integrations

⚠ Challenges you’d face as a systems manager/adviser
1️⃣ Data silos + integration gaps

Systems between agencies may not talk smoothly to each other.

Client → Avidity → field teams → feedback loops are often fragmented.
Your challenge: Design a unified data architecture + integration strategy.

2️⃣ Legacy tech debt

Old systems that “just work” but are brittle and costly.

Migration projects will meet internal resistance (“why change?”).
Your challenge: Prioritize modernization without breaking mission-critical ops.

3️⃣ Low AI + automation maturity

Lots of data, not enough automation or machine learning.

Manual reporting, Excel jockeying, and heavy analyst time.
Your challenge: Introduce automation + AI in stages, with clear ROI.

4️⃣ Change management + culture

Teams are likely comfortable in their current tools + processes.

Field teams and managers may distrust “black box” AI or dashboards.
Your challenge: Lead change with transparency, training, and by showing small wins.

5️⃣ Client-specific demands + complexity

Every big client has unique systems, data needs, and reporting expectations.
Your challenge: Build flexible, modular systems that can adapt to each client without reinventing the wheel.

6️⃣ Cybersecurity + compliance

With lots of retailer and consumer data, Avidity is a tempting target.

GDPR and data privacy regulations are critical.
Your challenge: Ensure compliance, risk management, and secure architectures.

💥 What success would look like
✅ Unified data platform across agencies
✅ Automated insights + AI-assisted workflows
✅ Strong integration between client data, Avidity systems, and field teams
✅ Clear governance, documentation, and training
✅ A culture that values experimentation, innovation, and learning
